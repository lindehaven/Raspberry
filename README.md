# RASPBERRY

## Background

Got myself a Raspberry Pi Zero W to tinker with. A small one-board computer
that is easy to develop software for. I like that. Here are my projects.

## Temperature

This project measures the temperature using a Maxim DS18B20 1-wire sensor,
stores the temperature in a Maria DB and displays temperatures on an Apache
web page.

I used the project "Raspberry Pi Temperature Sensor: Build a DS18B20 Circuit
https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-temperature-sensor/ and added a database
and a web server.

See `Temperature/README.md`.
